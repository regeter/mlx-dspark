"""Nucleus (top-p) / top-k truncation for lossless speculative *sampling*.

To keep speculative sampling lossless while honoring OpenAI's ``top_p`` / ``top_k``, the
truncation must be applied to the **target** distribution the accept test samples from — and,
so acceptance doesn't collapse, to the **draft** proposal too. This module provides one
primitive, :func:`truncate_probs`, used on both sides (draft q and target p) with the same
parameters. The output is then an exact sample from ``top-p/top-k(softmax(target_logits / T))``.

Identity fast-path: ``top_p >= 1.0`` and ``top_k <= 0`` returns the input untouched, so the
default temperature-sampling path (and greedy) is byte-for-byte unchanged.
